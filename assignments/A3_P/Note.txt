** Generic in Java,   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generics-in-java/   ** Needs to go over the chapter **
Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. 

The Object is the superclass of all other classes, and Object reference can refer to any object.
